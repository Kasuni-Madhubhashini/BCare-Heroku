          <p class="text">
            Maintaining a healthy weight might lower the risk of various types of cancer, including cancer of the
            breast, prostate, lung, colon and kidney.
            Physical activity counts, too. In addition to helping you control your weight, physical activity on its own
            might lower the risk of breast cancer and colon cancer.
            Adults who participate in any amount of physical activity gain some health benefits. But for substantial
            health benefits, strive to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes a week
            of vigorous aerobic activity. You can also do a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. As a general
            goal, include at least 30 minutes of physical activity in your daily routine — and if you can do more, even
            better.

          <p class="text">
            Although making healthy selections at the grocery store and at mealtime can't guarantee cancer prevention,
            it might reduce your risk. Consider these guidelines:<br>

            • Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables - Base your diet on fruits, vegetables and other foods from plant
            sources — such as whole grains and beans.<br><br>

            • Limit processed meats. A report from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the cancer agency of
            the World Health Organization, concluded that eating large amounts of processed meat can slightly increase
            the risk of certain types of cancer.<br><br>
            • Keep alcohol at moderate levels or lower (a drink a day or under). While moderate drinking can be good for
            the heart in older adults, even low levels of intake can increase the risk of breast cancer. If you don’t
            drink, don’t feel you need to start. If you drink moderately, there’s likely no reason to stop. But, if you
            drink more, you should cut down or quit.

          <p class="text">
            Smokers and non-smokers alike know how unhealthy smoking is. On top of lowering quality of life and
            increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and at least 15 cancers – including breast cancer – it also
            causes smelly breath, bad teeth, and wrinkles. Now that’s motivation to stay smoke-free or work to get
            smoke-free.

          <p class="text">
            Birth control pills have both risks and benefits. The younger a woman is, the lower the risks are. While
            women are taking birth control pills, they have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer. This risk goes
            away quickly, though, after stopping the pill. The risk of stroke and heart attack is also increased while
            on the pill – particularly if a woman smokes. However, long-term use can also have important benefits, like
            lowering the risk of ovarian cancer, colon cancer and uterine cancer – not to mention unwanted pregnancy –
            so there’s also a lot in its favor. If you’re very concerned about breast cancer, avoiding birth control
            pills is one option to lower risk.

          <p class="text">
            Post-menopausal hormones shouldn’t be taken long term to prevent chronic diseases, like osteoporosis and
            heart disease. Studies show they have a mixed effect on health, increasing the risk of some diseases and
            lowering the risk of others, and both estrogen only hormones and estrogen-plus-progestin hormones increase
            the risk of breast cancer. If women do take post-menopausal hormones, it should be for the shortest time
            possible. The best person to talk to about the risks and benefits of post-menopausal hormones is your
            doctor.

          <p class="text">
            Despite some controversy, studies show that breast cancer screening with mammography saves lives. It doesn’t
            help prevent cancer, but it can help find cancer early when it’s most treatable. For most women, regular
            mammograms can begin at age 40, but specific recommendations vary by age and risk.<br><br>
            If you are age 40 – 44:
            You can choose to begin yearly mammograms. It is important to talk to a doctor about the risk and benefits
            of mammograms at these ages.<br><br>
            If you are age 45 – 54:
            Mammograms are recommended every year.<br><br>
            If you are age 55 or over:
            Mammograms are recommended every other year. You can choose to continue to have them every year.<br><br>
